  2. Use 'lucide-react' for icons.
  3. Use standard 'fetch' for Google Fit API calls (no external heavy SDKs unless necessary).
  4. Design: "Calm, clear, minimal". ample whitespace.
  5. All data fetching must happen in Server Components or Server Actions.
  6. Do not assume any previous code exists; write full files when asked.
